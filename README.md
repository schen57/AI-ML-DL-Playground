# AI-ML-DL-Playground
Explore and experiment in order to learn about AI/ML/DL



Learning Paths to complete mastery of AI/ML/DL and ultimately building a pure AI/ML/DL application
This is a tall goal but in the plan to become familiar with the end to end build, I have some basic ideas of how to get there and what the necessary steps I should take. This repository serves as a documentation of the journey to get there.

Roughly, I plan to tackle the following key components to setting up the ML pipeline through the following:
1. Data Extraction ( Some sort of web-scraping or set up a database of collecting data )
2. Data ETL ( Cleaning and merging the data in need and prepare them for the later analytics )
3. Data Exploratory Analysis (In this component, data needs to be further transformed and whipped into the right shape, Data visualization is also an important sub-category. Some sort of dashboarding could be built as a result to better represent the underlying data)
4. Feature Engineering (Based on the understanding of the data from EDA step, key variables need to be extracted and prepared for later model building)
5. Model Building (Running various machine learning techniques and build models to achieve certain accuracy. Models could also include Deep Learning algorithms etc.)
6. App Building (App building in itself is a separate category but the purpose of putting this here is to help evolve the model built into an end-user friendly, consumable product. Models, data refresh, model refresh all need to be baked into production )

#### These are my current thoughts as of now. Will come and update if there are more thoughts around this
